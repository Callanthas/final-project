# Welcome to the UCSR - Unified Community Service Register.

Go to http://powerful-dawn-60700.herokuapp.com/ to access it.

This program has the goal of helping to register the Community Service hours for students and project leaders, as well as updating the database for the school.
It will allow the student to Check In when they arrive to do their Community Service, and the data will be verified by the project Leader. Once approved, it will update the total hours worked for the student.
